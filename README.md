# Project Boilerplate

Welcome to the Project Boilerplate! This repository serves as a starting point for new projects, providing a standardized structure, configurations, and common functionalities to streamline development and maintain consistency across projects.

## Features

### Analytics Manager

The Analytics Manager facilitates tracking of user interactions and events within the application. It integrates with various analytics platforms (e.g., Google Analytics, Firebase Analytics) to collect and analyze user data, helping you gain insights into user behavior and app performance.

### Environment Setup

The Environment Setup ensures seamless configuration of project environments (e.g., Development, Staging, Production). It includes scripts and configurations to manage environment-specific variables, API endpoints, and other settings, enabling smooth deployment and testing across different environments.

### Push Notifications

The Push Notifications feature enables sending push notifications to users' devices, keeping them engaged and informed about relevant updates, promotions, or events. It integrates with push notification services (e.g., Firebase Cloud Messaging, Apple Push Notification Service) to deliver messages to targeted users.

### Crashlytics Manager

The Crashlytics Manager provides crash reporting and error tracking capabilities to monitor app stability and identify issues in real-time. It integrates with crash reporting services (e.g., Firebase Crashlytics, Sentry) to capture crash reports, stack traces, and other diagnostic information, helping you diagnose and fix app crashes quickly.

### Force Update Manager

The Force Update Manager ensures that users always have the latest version of the app by enforcing mandatory updates when a new version is available. It checks for app updates on launch and prompts users to update if their current version is outdated, ensuring a consistent user experience and compliance with app requirements.
